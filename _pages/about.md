I'm a fourth year undergraduate student from [School of Electronics and Communications Engineering](https://sece.sysu.edu.cn/), [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes SLAM, Computer Vision and Robotics Vision, Robotics, Artificial Intelligence.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. WangLiang](https://sece.sysu.edu.cn/szll/js/1361718.htm) of Intelligent Electro-Optical Vision Sensing Lab from [School of Electronics and Communications Engineering](https://sece.sysu.edu.cn/), [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/).

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have held leadership positions such as President of the Student Union of the School of Electronics and Communications Engineering and Captain of the Electronics and Communications Engineering Football Team.

      <strong>Rapid Adaptive Semantic Map Update in Construction Site Scenarios</strong><br>
      - For efficient path planning in dynamic construction sites, we integrate current map data with semantic information to minimize the need for frequent remapping. By leveraging 3D object detection, we construct a prior semantic map, which enhances rapid localization and allows for quick adjustments using images and point clouds. This approach is being tested in collaboration with CSCEC at Baiyun Airport Terminal 3 <br>
