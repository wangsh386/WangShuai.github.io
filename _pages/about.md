I'm a fourth year undergraduate student from [School of Electronics and Communications Engineering](https://sece.sysu.edu.cn/), [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes SLAM, Computer Vision and Robotics Vision, Robotics, Artificial Intelligence.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. WangLiang](https://sece.sysu.edu.cn/szll/js/1361718.htm) of Intelligent Electro-Optical Vision Sensing Lab from [School of Electronics and Communications Engineering](https://sece.sysu.edu.cn/), [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/).

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have held leadership positions such as [President of the Student Union of the School of Electronics and Communications Engineering](../images/xueshenghui.png) and [Captain of the Electronics and Communications Engineering Football Team](../images/zuqiudui.png).

Research Experiences
========
### 05/2024 - Present  
**Rapid Adaptive Semantic Map Update in Construction Site Scenarios**  
**Supervisor:** Wang Liang  
- In the construction site scenario, for path planning of carts transporting materials, we need to integrate current map information. Construction site layouts can change slightly based on progress, making traditional methods costly as they require frequent remapping, especially in unchanged areas. Our goal is to eventually update prior maps quickly and locally by integrating semantic information.  
- We combined 3D object detection to construct a prior semantic map. Following this, we analyzed the advantages of utilizing the semantic map for rapid localization. Finally, we aim to quickly update the prior semantic map using both images and point clouds for small-scale adjustments. Currently, we are collaborating with China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC) to conduct on-site experiments at the Baiyun Airport Terminal 3.  
- As the primary responsible person, took charge of conducting literature review, determining research direction, research methods, and programming.

### 01/2024 - 06/2024  
**Drone Positioning Information-Assisted Reinforcement Learning Optimization Framework for IoT Data Collection**  
**Supervisor:** Sun Xinghua  
- Used Drones for assisted data collection and localization to cope with the problems of insufficient infrastructure coverage, the dynamics and uncertainty of the data collection process and sensor locations in the Internet of Things (IoT).  
- Proposed a framework to jointly optimize the data collection and device positioning performance of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), thereby significantly improving system performance.  
- Participated in paper writing and code programming.

### 01/2024 - 04/2024  
**Completed High-precision Lamination of COMS and Fiber Optic Panels Using a Vision System in a Coupling Project with Huawei**  
**Supervisor:** Wang Liang  
- Took charge of positioning and error detection in laminating processes using computer vision; took responsibilities for the software debugging part using a robotic arm based on Raspberry Pi to complete the hardware setup.  
- Been the first inventor of the patent.

### 10/2023 - 01/2024  
**Autocorrelation Sidelobe Suppression in MIMO Radar OFD-LFM Waveforms**  
**Supervisor:** Guo Rui  
- Explored the effect on autocorrelation sidelobe suppression by further dividing the OFD-LFM waveform into inhomogeneous time widths and bandwidths.  
- The final experimental results indicated that the autocorrelation sidelobes of the MIMO radar were further suppressed.  
- Published a first-author conference paper.
