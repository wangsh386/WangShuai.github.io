I'm a fourth year undergraduate student from [School of Electronics and Communications Engineering](https://sece.sysu.edu.cn/), [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes SLAM, Computer Vision and Robotics Vision, Robotics, Artificial Intelligence.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. WangLiang](https://sece.sysu.edu.cn/szll/js/1361718.htm) of Intelligent Electro-Optical Vision Sensing Lab from [School of Electronics and Communications Engineering](https://sece.sysu.edu.cn/), [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/).

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have held leadership positions such as President of the Student Union of the School of Electronics and Communications Engineering and Captain of the Electronics and Communications Engineering Football Team.

      <strong>Rapid Adaptive Semantic Map Update in Construction Site Scenarios</strong><br>
      - To enhance path planning efficiency on construction sites, we integrate semantic information to reduce the need for frequent map updates. We build a prior semantic map using 3D object detection, leveraging image data for guided localization and using it to assist point cloud semantic segmentation for rapid map adjustments. This approach is currently being tested in collaboration with CSCEC at Baiyun Airport Terminal 3. <br>

      <strong>Drone Positioning Information-Assisted Reinforcement Learning Optimization Framework for IoT Data Collection</strong><br>
      - Drones are increasingly used in data collection and localization due to their flexibility. This paper proposes a framework to optimize drone data collection and localization in IoT, addressing issues like infrastructure gaps and sensor dynamics. Using traditional reinforcement learning (e.g., Q-learning), we optimize trajectory planning and enhance model efficiency to reduce computational complexity. Simulations show our method improves data collection by 80% and reduces convergence time by 40%.<br>

      <strong>Completed High-precision Lamination of COMS and Fiber Optic Panels Using a Vision System in a Coupling Project with Huawei</strong><br>
      - This project involved using computer vision to ensure high-precision lamination of COMS and fiber optic panels. Responsibilities included positioning, error detection, and the implementation of the process using a robotic arm, culminating in a patent as the first inventor and shared results at the International Congress of Intelligent Industries.<br>

      <strong>Autocorrelation Sidelobe Suppression in MIMO Radar OFD-LFM Waveforms</strong><br>
      - This research focused on optimizing OFD-LFM waveforms in MIMO radar systems to suppress autocorrelation sidelobes. A waveform optimization strategy was proposed, involving unequal modulation bandwidth and time width for each sub-signal. A genetic algorithm was used to minimize sidelobes, leading to significant radar performance improvements and a first-author conference paper. <br>
