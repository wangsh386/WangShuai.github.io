I'm a fourth year undergraduate student from [School of Electronics and Communications Engineering](https://sece.sysu.edu.cn/), [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes SLAM, Computer Vision and Robotics Vision, Robotics, Artificial Intelligence.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. WangLiang](https://sece.sysu.edu.cn/szll/js/1361718.htm) of Intelligent Electro-Optical Vision Sensing Lab from [School of Electronics and Communications Engineering](https://sece.sysu.edu.cn/), [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/).

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have held leadership positions such as President of the Student Union of the School of Electronics and Communications Engineering and Captain of the Electronics and Communications Engineering Football Team.

**Rapid Adaptive Semantic Map Update in Construction Site Scenarios**  
**Supervisor:** Wang Liang  
- In the construction site scenario, for path planning of carts transporting materials, we need to integrate current map information. Construction site layouts can change slightly based on progress, making traditional methods costly as they require frequent remapping, especially in unchanged areas. Our goal is to eventually update prior maps quickly and locally by integrating semantic information.  
- We combined 3D object detection to construct a prior semantic map. Following this, we analyzed the advantages of utilizing the semantic map for rapid localization. Finally, we aim to quickly update the prior semantic map using both images and point clouds for small-scale adjustments. Currently, we are collaborating with China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC) to conduct on-site experiments at the Baiyun Airport Terminal 3.  
- As the primary responsible person, took charge of conducting literature review, determining research direction, research methods, and programming.  
**快速自适应语义地图更新在施工现场的应用**  
**导师:** 王亮  
- 在施工现场场景中，为了规划运输材料的小车路径，我们需要整合当前的地图信息。施工现场布局可能会随着进度发生轻微变化，传统方法由于需要频繁重新绘制地图，尤其是在未变化的区域，成本较高。我们的目标是通过整合语义信息，最终快速、本地化更新先前的地图。  
- 我们结合了3D物体检测构建了先验语义地图。接下来，我们分析了使用语义地图进行快速定位的优势。最后，我们的目标是通过图像和点云来快速更新先验语义地图，以进行小范围的调整。目前，我们正与中国建筑工程总公司（CSCEC）合作，在白云机场三号航站楼进行现场实验。  
- 作为主要负责人，负责文献综述、确定研究方向、研究方法和编程工作。 |
